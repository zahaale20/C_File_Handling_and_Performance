The plots for the read and fread take on a similar shape; however, from my testing fread is significantly more efficient.
The reason for this is because every time read is used, it makes a system call. This takes longer than what it takes for fread
because fread can reduce the number of systems calls by its buffering functionality (reading more data than what is requested).
